# LeNet_numpy
Implementation of LeNet based on purely Numpy.

Transfered from Pytorch implementation of LeNet

Todo list:
-[] Implement My_Conv2d, My_Flatten, My_MaxPool2d and My_Linear class.
-[] Train on MINST dataset, which would be temporarily loaded via torchvision
-[] Construct dataloader from scratch
-[] Train on MINST again
